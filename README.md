Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Internship Task Overview

This repository contains Task 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) .
In this task, I performed EDA on a dataset collected in Task 1 using Octoparse. 
The goal of this task is to understand the dataset, clean it, identify patterns and trends, and visualize insights using Python.

🎯 Objectives of Task 2

Ask meaningful questions about the dataset before analysis

Understand the structure of the dataset (rows, columns, data types)

Clean the dataset (handle missing values and duplicates)

Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies

Visualize the data using graphs

Gain hands-on experience with real-world data

🗂 Dataset Information

Source: Web scraping using Octoparse (Task 1)

File Type: Excel (.xlsx)

Task1 dataset: https://github.com/Derlisha-16/codealpha_bookscraping-task1-/blob/main/Book_scrap.xlsx

Dataset file:Book_scrap.xlsx

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas (Data Manipulation)

Matplotlib (Data Visualization)


🔍 Steps Performed in Exploratory Data Analysis

1️⃣ Data Loading

Loaded the Excel dataset into a Pandas DataFrame using read_excel()

Displayed the first few rows to understand the data


2️⃣ Understanding the Dataset

Checked the number of rows and columns

Identified column names and data types

Analyzed missing values using df.info()


3️⃣ Data Cleaning

Removed duplicate records

Handled missing values appropriately

Ensured correct data types for analysis


4️⃣ Data Visualization

The following visualizations were created:

Histogram to understand numeric data distribution

Bar chart for categorical data frequency

Scatter plot to observe relationships between numerical variables


These visualizations helped in identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies in the dataset.
